# Health Insurance Prediction 💸🩺

A machine learning model built using **TensorFlow** that predicts individual health insurance costs based on personal and demographic information. The model learns patterns from factors like age, BMI, smoking status, region, and number of dependents to estimate insurance charges.

### 🔍 Overview
This regression project focuses on accurately predicting insurance premiums using deep learning. The dataset is cleaned, preprocessed, and fed into a fully connected neural network built with TensorFlow's Keras API.

### 🧠 Model
- **Algorithm Used**: Deep Neural Network (DNN)
- **Framework**: TensorFlow / Keras
- **Performance**: Achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) under a reasonable range during evaluation
- **Features Used**: Age, sex, BMI, children, smoker, region
